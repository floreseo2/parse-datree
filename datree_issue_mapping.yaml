CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_PRIVILEGED_VALUE_TRUE:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: High risk, as if running over the host directly
CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RUNASNONROOT_VALUE:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: Unnecessary privileges ease exploitation of any vulnerabilities
CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RUNASUSER_VALUE_LOWUID:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: >
        A UID number lower than 10000 allows accessing host-based files in
        case a container gains access to a host's file system
CONTAINERS_INVALID_CAPABILITIES_VALUE:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: Insecure kernel capabilities available from pod at runtime
CONTAINERS_MISSING_KEY_ALLOWPRIVILEGEESCALATION:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: Escalated container privileges give an entry point for successful attacks to the platform
CONTAINERS_MISSING_READINESSPROBE_KEY:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: Kubernetes cannot determine if pod is ready to receive traffic
CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: Kubernetes cannot determine if pod is alive
CONTAINER_CVE2021_25741_INCORRECT_SUBPATH_KEY:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: May gain access to the host filesystem and compromise the Kubernetes node
DEPLOYMENT_INCORRECT_REPLICAS_VALUE:
    relevance: 01-HIGH
    impact: No HA. Self-healing cannot avoid service disruption
CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_READONLYROOTFILESYSTEM_VALUE:
    relevance: 02-MEDIUM
    impact: Risk of image/SW tampering
EKS_INVALID_CAPABILITIES_EKS:
    relevance: 02-MEDIUM
    impact: EKS only
CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_LIMIT_KEY:
    relevance: 02-MEDIUM
    impact: Risk of a pod to consume all memory resources on a node
CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_REQUEST_KEY:
    relevance: 02-MEDIUM
    impact: Risk of a pod to be starved of memory resources
CIS_INVALID_VALUE_SECCOMP_PROFILE:
    relevance: 03-LOW
    impact: Docker runtime only
CIS_MISSING_VALUE_DROP_NET_RAW:
    relevance: 03-LOW
    impact: Docker runtime only
